          As a design firm we specialise in multidisciplinary design domains
          like Residence design, Retail design, exhibition design, Commercial
          Architecture, Interior design, and Museum Architecture with a focus on

          We explore ways to engage the user, the way they move through the
          space. We like taking design to an extremely conceptual stage. We find
          inspiration in ordinary things, everyday events and chance encounters.

          The firm takes a deeply contextual approach to its work and combines
          this with a strong focus on the tactile and sensory qualities of the
          space. Our design process looks at sustainability through the multiple
          lenses of cultural, social and environmental impact. There is an
          active engagement in integrating localised skills and resources with
          state-of-the art materials and technologies.
